## 👋 Overview

I build and maintain backend systems where **scale, correctness, and reliability** matter.

My work focuses on designing APIs, services, and distributed components that behave predictably under load, remain debuggable in production, and evolve without breaking existing consumers.

I value **clear design decisions**, **boring reliability**, and **code that survives change**.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

- Backend development using **Java (8–21)** and **Spring Boot**
- Designing **microservices**, REST APIs, and distributed workflows
- JVM fundamentals, concurrency, thread safety, and performance
- System design with emphasis on scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability
- Frontend collaboration using **Angular** with performance-first thinking
- Production debugging, incident analysis, and long-term fixes

I don’t chase tools — I choose them deliberately based on constraints.
