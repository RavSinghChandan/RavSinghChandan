## 👋 About Me

I’m a **senior full-stack Java engineer** focused on building **reliable, high-throughput, production-grade systems** used in real-world environments where **correctness, performance, and stability matter**.

I work closest to the **core of systems**:
- API and data contracts  
- concurrency and thread safety  
- distributed communication and messaging  
- failure handling and resilience  
- long-term maintainability and evolution  

I don’t optimize for demos.  
I optimize for **what survives production**.

---

## 🧠 How I Think as an Engineer

I approach software the same way strong product companies do:

- **Correctness before cleverness**
- **Design for failure, not the happy path**
- **Measure before optimizing**
- **Prefer clarity over accidental complexity**
- **Build systems that age well**

> Senior engineering is not about knowing more tools —  
> it’s about making fewer, better decisions under constraints.

## 🏗️ What I Build

### Backend & Systems
- High-throughput **Java / Spring Boot microservices**
- Event-driven architectures using **Kafka**
- Secure, well-designed REST APIs
- JVM-aware performance tuning and GC behavior
- Observability, logging, and production diagnostics

### Frontend (Full-Stack)
- Scalable **Angular** applications (RxJS, NgRx)
- Change-detection and performance-aware UI design
- Clean frontend–backend contracts
- Enterprise-grade routing, security, and state management

### Platform & Delivery
- Dockerized services
- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud deployments (AWS)
- Production readiness over local success

## 🚀 Selected Work & Learning Systems

### 🔹 `awesome-dsa-gamification`
A structured, gamified approach to mastering **problem-solving and DSA**, focused on:
- patterns over memorization
- interview-grade thinking
- long-term skill compounding  

**Signal:** Ability to **systematize learning and complexity**.

---

### 🔹 `awesome-low-level-design`
A practical guide to **real-world LLD**, covering:
- SOLID principles
- UML-driven modeling
- object responsibility and boundaries
- trade-offs instead of textbook answers  

**Signal:** Thinks in **systems and responsibilities**, not just code.

---

### 🔹 TechWithRav (Knowledge Sharing)
Through **TechWithRav**, I break down:
- JVM internals
- concurrency
- system design
- backend architecture  

The goal is clarity — not hype.

---

## 🌱 Beyond Code (My Edge)

Alongside engineering, I study **decision-making, intuition, and long-term alignment**.  
This gives me a calm, grounded approach — especially valuable in **high-pressure, high-stakes systems like finance and payments**.

I’m comfortable:
- owning complex systems
- debugging production issues
- reasoning clearly under uncertainty
- mentoring others toward senior-level thinking

---

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m interested in **senior / staff-level roles** where I can:

- own critical backend systems  
- influence architecture and design decisions  
- work on problems where scale, correctness, and reliability truly matter  

Product-focused companies.  
Strong engineering culture.  
Long-term thinking.
