## Overview

I build backend systems that are expected to **work every day**, not just during demos.

Most of my time goes into making systems predictable under load, debuggable when things break, and easy to evolve when requirements change. I care deeply about **clarity**, **ownership**, and **long-term reliability**.

---

## How I Think About Engineering

I’ve learned that good systems are rarely clever.

They are:
- clear in intent  
- boring in reliability  
- honest about trade-offs  

I design with failure in mind, question unnecessary abstractions, and write code for the engineer who will read it a year later.

## What I Work With

**Backend:** Java (8–21), Spring Boot, Kafka, REST APIs  
**Frontend:** Angular, RxJS  
**Data:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle  
**Architecture:** Microservices, Event-Driven Systems  
**Ops:** Docker, CI/CD, AWS  

---

## What Matters to Me

- Systems that survive **real production traffic**
- Bugs that only appear **under concurrency**
- Fewer abstractions, clearer boundaries
- Code that stays readable as teams grow
- Thinking in **systems**, not tickets

---

## This GitHub

You’ll find:
- Backend projects built with production patterns
- Design patterns explained through real use-cases
- Code written for clarity, not cleverness

Small repos. Clear intent. No noise.

## Current Direction

Building depth in backend architecture and distributed systems, while sharing practical lessons through TechWithRav.

Open to senior backend / full-stack roles where **ownership and judgment** matter.
