## Overview

I design, build, and maintain backend systems where **correctness, reliability, and scale** are non-negotiable.

My experience spans building APIs, microservices, and distributed components that operate under real production constraints — concurrency, partial failures, evolving requirements, and long-term maintainability.

I focus on **clear design decisions**, **predictable system behavior**, and **code that remains understandable years later**.

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- Prefer **simple, explicit designs** over clever abstractions
- Optimize first for **correctness**, then for performance
- Treat failures as a design input, not an edge case
- Write code for the **next engineer**, not just the compiler
- Measure systems by how they behave **under load**, not in demos

I don’t chase tools — I choose them deliberately based on constraints.

---

## Technical Focus

- Backend development using **Java (8–21)** and **Spring Boot**
- Designing **microservices**, REST APIs, and distributed workflows
- JVM fundamentals: memory model, concurrency, thread safety, performance
- System design with emphasis on scalability, fault tolerance, and operability
- Event-driven systems and asynchronous processing
- Production debugging, incident analysis, and permanent fixes
- Frontend collaboration using **Angular** with performance-first thinking

---

## Core Technology Stack

**Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, REST APIs  
**Frontend:** Angular, RxJS  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle  
**Architecture:** Microservices, Event-Driven Systems  
**DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD, AWS  
**Practices:** Code reviews, design docs, production monitoring

---

## What I Care About

- Designing systems that survive **real production traffic**
- Debugging issues that surface **only under concurrency**
- Reducing coupling without over-engineering
- Making trade-offs explicit and reversible
- Writing code that remains readable and maintainable **over time**
- Thinking in **systems**, not just features

## What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub profile contains:

- Backend-focused projects built with production patterns in mind
- Practical implementations of **design patterns** and **system design concepts**
- Code structured for clarity, testability, and long-term maintenance
- Examples and notes used while mentoring and teaching via TechWithRav

Repositories here are intentionally small, focused, and opinionated — optimized for **signal over volume**.

---

## Current Direction

- Deepening expertise in **backend architecture and distributed systems**
- Building clear, real-world explanations for complex engineering concepts
- Preparing for **senior backend / full-stack roles** in product-driven engineering teams
- Contributing where system design, reliability, and ownership matter
